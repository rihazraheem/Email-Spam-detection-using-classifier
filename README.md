# Email-Spam-detection-using-classifier
Using machine learning algorithms we can detect the spam messages in Emails. 
Here we used a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and Tfidf vectorizer are used in order to teach the system, that a given message is spam or not.
The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). 
The dataset is a set of SMS tagged with legitimate (ham) and spam. The dataset is taken from an open-source website, Kaggle.com
